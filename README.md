# floydd_warshal

The Floydâ€“Warshall algorithm is a graph analysis algorithm for finding shortest paths in
a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles, see below)
and also for finding transitive closure of a relation . A single execution of the algorithm will find the
lengths (summed weights) of the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices, though it does not
return details of the paths themselves.
